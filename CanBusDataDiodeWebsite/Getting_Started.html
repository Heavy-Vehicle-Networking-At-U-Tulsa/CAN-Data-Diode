	 <h1> Getting Started with the Data Diode: </h1>
	 <p> Instructions are written for a Windows machine. All program downloads and software requirements will be listed in the downloads section of this website, along with a printable copy of the following instructions.<br /> </p>
	 <p> The following instructions are written with the assumption that you have received a data diode testing kit. If you do not have a kit, please <a href="/C:/Users/Hayden%20Allen/Desktop/CanBusDataDiodeWebsite/apply.html"><b>submit an application.</b></a> <br/></p>
	 <h2><b> Setting Up Arduino IDE </b></h2>
	 <p> To begin, started by downloading the Arduino IDE. If you are unfamiliar with how to use the IDE, <a href="#"><b>here</b></a> is a good introduction to the work space. There are many quick guides available online.<p>
	 <h3> Once the Arduino IDE has been installed, and you are familiar with the workspace, you will need to locate the supplied ISP device. This device is pictured below: <br/><br/> "image placeholder" <br/><br/> Using the supplied USB cable, connect this device to your computer.
	 Allow any required drivers to install. Next we will navigate to our computer. <br/><br/> "Image Placeholder" "Image Placeholder"<br/><br/> Here we will determine which communication port the ISP device is connected to. For us, the computer used port #<br/><br/>
	On your machine this may be different, now navigate into the Arduino IDE, and ensure that the port of your ISP is correct.<br/> <br/> "Image Placeholder"<br/> <br/> We will then configure the IDE to use the supplied Arduino Nano, as an ISP. Seen below: <br/><br/> PLC <br/><br/> </h3>
	<h2><b> Download Github Repository </b></h2>
	<p> The device will function properly as delivered. It will not allow messages to be transmitted from one side to the other; however, to optimize the functionality of the device, it is necessary to program the two on board micro-controllers. Currently, the following
	github repository has provisions for sending request messages on the J1939 side of the network, with example code for requesting VIN and Engine Hours. Additionally, code to pull the silent pin on the CAN transceiver has been added to accommodate a high error count event
	on the ELD side of the network. The Github repository can be found here: <br/><br/> Link to github repository and maybe a github logo or something <br/><br/> </p>
